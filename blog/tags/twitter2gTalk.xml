            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Get your tweets onto Google Talk!</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>: A free social networking and micro-blogging
service that allows users to send "updates" (or "tweets"; text-based posts, up
to 140 characters long) to the Twitter website, via short message service
(SMS), instant messaging, or a third-party application such as Twitterrific or
Facebook.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">gTalk</a>: (Google Talk) is a Windows and web-based
application for voice over internet (VOIP) and instant messaging, offered by
Google.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter2gtalk.appspot.com/">twitter2gTalk</a>: Takes your current tweet
and sets it as your Google Talk status (away) message.</p>

<p>I've been toying with <a href="http://blog.gpowered.net/2008/03/update-google-talk-status-with-twitter.html">this</a> for a while now. I really wanted to launch
twitter2gTalk as a service that anyone could use. I had the backend code all
done and was dragging my feet writing the django front-end. I went to a
hackathon for <a href="code.google.com/appengine/">Google AppEngine</a> and converted
most of the code to run on that. You need a Google Account to login, but then
again, you need one to use gTalk anyway.</p>

<p>I hope some people will find this cool or useful (some people have been
<a href="http://heavycrag.blogspot.com/2008/05/new-reason-to-tweet.html">waiting</a> for
this and already signed up). Feel free to follow
<a href="http://twitter.com/broderboy">me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/twit2gTalk">the app</a>
on twitter for feature updates or
