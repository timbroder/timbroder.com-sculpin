  <p>In reality, we do all sorts of things at our desks that aren’t real work (or affect our ability to produce our best work).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​We do do a lot at our desks. It's interesting though how much of "work" has spilled onto our other devices. At least during the day I'm in outlook and Omnifocus on my phone. When I have 1:1s with my directs, I bring my iPad with Omnifocus to review goals or notes I've kept track of</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thinking: Nobody does their best thinking sitting at their desk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do my best thinking in the shower at home. I've had sooooo many epiphanies over the years in the shower. Either brand new ideas or some problem that may have had me stumped for days.</p>

<p>I think it's the sensory deprivation. There's nothing to distract you, your mind is free to wander, and there is plenty of ambient noise. Sing if it helps!</p>

<p>This doesn't work as well for me in the shower at the gym. I'm usually rushing to let the next people in or to get to work, and the water temperature is usually lukewarm or cold to help me cool down. Anything I can help to do stop my sweating before work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Socializing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think a standing desk hurts me on this regard. I notice that more people come up to me to chit chat than if my desk is down and I'm sitting</p>

  <p>It’s worth mentioning that we don’t just talk externally about Open Source. Internally, the Mobile team runs talks about Open Source for the rest of the Artsy staff. As well, we discuss the tooling and business implications of having our work in public repos. Artsy strives for an open culture, in this case the development team, on the whole, is just further along in the process.</p>

  <p>I actually treated a vacation like a vacation but I fully expected to be stuck attending to work, checking RSS, and the like. Turns out it was kind of... nice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I'm pretty good about doing this. Work email and calendar are deleted from my phone when I go on vacation. If there is a true emergency, I'll get a text or a phone call.</p>

<p>Vacations are important. You need to recharge, you need a mental break. Give your mind some rest.</p>

<p>This is especially important from work, but other things as well.</p>

<p>On as many vacations as I can (especially beach ones) I'll go into "no devices mode". No phone, tablet, TV. just books. My Kindle gets a pass. Sometimes. Others I'll grab some library books. On vacation to Italy last year, I made an exception with Instapaper. I shouldn't have. Our train rides became about getting through as much Instapaper as possible instead of a relaxing read or enjoying the countryside</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is more new stuff on the internet that I'd like to be a part of than I have hours in the day to participate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeeeeeah</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's been a long time since I had to accept that I won't be able to take it all in. Still, I try.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do too. There are more tweets, RSS/Instapaper articles, and podcasts than I can keep up with. I want t,o but let's be realistic. I read Twitter as a completionist or I've been known to take a week or even a month off. For RSS and Instapaper I mark everything as read twice a year; On New Years and my birthday. My podcasts I should really prune. Some I listen every week, some I cherry pick. I think I need less that I want to listen to every episode</p>

  <section class="post-content"><p>Originally posted on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31441807/invalid-predicate-when-filtering-ckrecords-by-the-same-keys" title="StackOverflow">StackOverflow</a></p>

<p>I have a CKRecord type "Follow" which stores the user's ID and the ID of a friend they follow. (Assume that a user can only follow 1 person and the logic around that is handled elsewhere).</p>

<p>Screenshot of record definition in CloudKit</p>

<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/313/20186044436_b4629376af_z_d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I want to query the Follow records to confirm that two users follow each other and are in fact, friends.</p>

<p>These are the base queries. Each works fine on it's own</p>

<pre><code data-language="swift">let followPredicate = NSPredicate(format: "userID == %@ AND followsID == %@", userId, followsID)
let followedPredicate = NSPredicate(format: "followsID == %@ AND userID == %@", userId, followsID)
</code></pre>

<p>I want to combine these two predicates and query once, so that if two records come back, it's assumed that the different users follow each other</p>

<p>I've tried to combine them both manually and by using a NSCompoundPredicate:</p>

<pre><code data-language="swift">let friendPredicate = NSCompoundPredicate(type: NSCompoundPredicateType.OrPredicateType, subpredicates: [followPredicate, followedPredicate])
let friendPredicate = NSPredicate(format: "(followsID == %@ AND userID == %@) OR (userID == %@ AND followsID == %@)", userId, followsID, userId, followsID)
</code></pre>

<p>I then use the query here:</p>

<pre><code data-language="swift">let friendQuery = CKQuery(recordType: "Follow", predicate: friendPredicate)
</code></pre>

<p>In both versions of friendPredicate above, I get an Invalid Predicate Exception.</p>

  <section class="post-content"><blockquote>
  <p>For me being active is like meditation, a daily ritual that keeps me sane amid the chaos of my life. Without it I feel weak, lethargic and a little depressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This very much holds true for me. There was a period of time a few months ago where the gym I was going to closed for renovations. I thought I could keep up with my activity at home. I planned on running, doing <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fitstar-personal-trainer-burn/id535640259?mt=8&amp;at=11laRZ&amp;ct=Wflw6" title="%fill:name%">FitStar</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yoga-studio/id567767430?mt=8&amp;at=11laRZ&amp;ct=Wflw6" title="%fill:name%">Yoga</a> from my phone, and doing kettle bell work. For the most part I stuck with this. But only in a certain sense. Yes I was going for runs. But not as hard as I should have. Yes, I was doing FitStar, but wasn't getting my heart rate up enough. I slacked on the kettle bell work. None of this had me lifting heavy or getting my hear rate through the roof.  (I need both of these for stress relief)</p>

<p>It eventually had an effect on me. I became more stressed and depressed. It was harder to get up for my early alarm to try to be active before work. (I can't work out after work. I either don't have time, am exhausted, or want to go spend time with my family or TV).</p>

<p>I should have seen this coming. I wish I had but I didn't.</p>

<p>Part of this is the social aspect of the gym. I've been training with the same group of people for almost 6 years. Seeing them in the morning and shooting the shit is a strong part of my week. We've become close friends. Having that missing also contributed to my negative mood</p>

<p>After a while I stared realizing that our gym wasn't going to reopen. That I was using that as an excuse to not find a new gym. We had talked about it but were all lethargic about pulling the trigger. One weekend I couldn't take it anymore. "I need to lift something". I texted a few people and we did a drop in at a new gym that Monday. The facility is ok, the people are great, and the programming is fantastic. We've re-upped our membership and I'm very happy to be pushing myself again</p>

<p>Paternity leave threw a little bit of a wrench into this. I knew it was coming and knew I would have to find a gym close to home. (I train in the city near where I work). I found one close by. It's not one I would join full time, but it's great for a stop gap during leave/vacation or the odd weekend. I've only gone once a week (setting an alarm with a new born is risky. Yes I acknowledge that I'm using that as an excuse and should have sucked it up a lot more). I've also been running and last week did the first longer run in over a year. I'm in week 4 and I'm starting to feel like I really, really need to lift something. But, next week I'm back in the saddle with work, and will be re-joining my friends at our new gym</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Giving up on something you have previously committed to isn’t an easy thing to do. It can feel like failure or defeat. But sometimes giving up your goal is the smartest thing to do. Sometimes the cost of achieving it isn’t worth the price of admission.</p>

  <section class="post-content"><p>Git 2.5 has been released with worktrees, better triangular workflows, and performance enhancements. Read GitHub's take on it <a href="https://github.com/blog/2042-git-2-5-including-multiple-worktrees-and-triangular-workflows" title="%fill:name%">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new Git subcommand git worktree creates additional working trees connected to an existing Git repository [1]. Each linked working tree is a pseudo-repository with its own checked-out working copy. Its .git is actually a file that refers to the history and references from the main repository</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice. This is Git's solution to having multiple clones for different long running streams. I do this more often than I thought</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Git has many features that support triangular workflows, but it’s sometimes hard to see how to use them together in real life. Let’s take a closer look at triangular workflows, including the new command line shorthand <reference>@{push} that was added in Git 2.5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is neat. It might take me a little while to adopt this. The existing flow works well for me</p>
