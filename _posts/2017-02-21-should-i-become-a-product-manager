> You should choose a career in product if you’re obsessed about your customers and the problems they have. Your job is all about bringing the customer pain to the team; being crisp on what you’re solving and why it’s worth solving. You should be able to feel your customers’ pain like it’s your own and have a strong urgency to represent their needs to your team.
