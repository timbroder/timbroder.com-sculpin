            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I posted on <a href="http://tekside.net/iphonaddict/2015/1/11/games-i-was-addicted-to-in-20">TekSide</a>:</p>

<p>I don't consider myself a gamer anymore. I used to be.
Countless, countless hours in Final Fantasy 6-9, Zelda, Tetris, Alleyway,
Neverwinter, Halo, Fallout, Half life, Oblivion. The list goes on. I cut my
teeth on a gameboy and SNES and kept going. Things dropped off after Halo 2. I
surfaced for Halo  3 (a lot) and 4 (less so). I didn't play much on my phone
during my years on Android; the games really weren't that great or polished.</p>

<p>Part of my commute is a 10 minute subway ride. Something quick to play is
appreciated, but I've been looking for something a little more immersive.
Something I can sit and get lost in for a few hours. The other part of my
commute is a 30 min commuter train ride where I'm either reading instapaper,
napping, or playing a game while listening to podcasts.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://apple.co/1DzraiL">Baldur's Gate</a></strong> - I
found this very late in the year. In fact I think I installed it at my in-laws
on Christmas morning. I had never played either of the originals and was
curious. It was one of the few games that consistently showed up on "best iOS
RPG" when I was searching for something to play. The face that it looked like
Neverwinter was a huge bonus for me. The tutorial for this game is very, very
buggy and was very off-putting. Once I got past that though, everything
changed. The game mechanics started making sense: pinching and zooming the map
is fluid and tapping on your party to direct their targets just felt
completely natural. The story quickly swept me in and I started questing. When
I play RPGs, I try to do all the side quests. Baldur's Gate is no different.
I'm currently grinding my way through a number of maps looking for someone's
lost cloak. Perfect gameplay for listening to podcasts on the train. Outside
of that though the music and sound effects are top notch. If you were ever a
fan of D&amp;D style point+click RPGs, this will feel right at home. If you've
never tried them, I can't recommend this game enough.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2015/03/1.png"><img src="/images/2015/03/1-1024x768.png" alt="1" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://apple.co/1Dzrkql">Tiny Tower</a> &amp; <a href="http://apple.co/1LGeXPK">Pocket Trains</a></strong> &#45; I put
these games together because while very different games, they have similar
gameplay mechanics. Build out your empire! In Tiny Tower, this takes the form
of expanding a single tower. Inside this tower are all your Bitizens live:
Where they eat, where they work, and where they have fun. Ala Sim City, but in
an enclosed environment. In Pocket trains, you expand your train line, going
for a trans-continental goal. Pick the cargo for your trains, build tracks,
repair the engines, and race against the clock. Both games have IAP to buy
coins and bucks to get you through the game faster. I've never used real world
money in either and it's just as enjoyable</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://apple.co/1LGeYmQ">RGB Express</a></strong> &#45; This is a good
puzzle game where you draw routes for your drivers, picking up packages and
making sure that every house receives the correct package. Setup your route,
press play, watch your trucks zoom, and hope you didn't create any collisions!
Pro Tip: You can set the playback to run the trucks at a faster speed. Kudos
to the iOSDocked crew for making this the GameCenter Showdown in episode 77.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://apple.co/1Dzrxdd">Threes</a></strong> - Threes is a tiny puzzle that grows on you. It looks simple at
first. But at some point you figure out you need a strategy to go higher.
Match the same number, it triples and collapses. Keep going. Build higher and
higher. Compete with your friends. It gets harder the higher you go and
becomes addicting trying to get to that next score. I play tower defense
style: Building into one of the top two corners and slowly growing numbers in
those directions. What's your high score?</p>

<p><a href="/images/2015/03/2.png"><img src="/images/2015/03/2.png" alt="2" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://apple.co/1LGf2Dc">2048</a></strong> &#45; This game is very similar to threes
(maybe too much so). But, it's still fun. I keep this one around because it
takes a little less concentration than threes. It's more mindless and good for
when I'm tired or need to think. It's a good distraction. 2048 is my checkers
to my Threes chess.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2015/03/3.png"><img src="/images/2015/03/3.png" alt="3" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://apple.co/1DzrKgm">Honorable Mention: Monument Valley</a></strong> &#45; I
can't stress enough that you NEED to go play this game. There is no other
experience like it on iOS. Control your character through immersive M.C.
Escher-like paintings. The levels are gorgeous. You'll spend time just staring
at them, moving pieces around just to see what they do. It only gets Honorable
Mention because of replay value. I played through it once in a few hours and
that was that. But, it's magical. Everyone should play it</p>

            <link href="https://www.timbroder.com/2014/05/reordering-nsfetchedresultscontroller.html"/>
            <updated>2014-05-31T16:14:22+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://www.timbroder.com/2014/05/reordering-nsfetchedresultscontroller.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m working with a NSFetchedResultsController backed UITableView.  Up until
now I’ve just been ordering the items by the time they were added.</p>

<p>I’m moving on to Delete and Edit.  Editing the content itself isn’t needed,
once an item is added to this list, it can’t be changed. Deleting is
straightforward in</p>

<pre><code data-language="c">(void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController *)controller
didChangeObject:(id)anObject atIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type newIndexPath:(NSIndexPath
*)newIndexPath {
</code></pre>

<p>With reordering, I have a conundrum.  I have an
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2013070/647343">approach</a> for the actual re-order
that will have the View and the data playing nice. But, now I need to persist
the order.  I don’t have a property in Core Data for this (yet).  I’m trying
to figure out what to set this property to. The brute force approach is to use
the indexPath of the cell.  I have concerns with this.  Adding an item
automatically puts it at the top of the list. This would give it an index of 0
(I only have 1 section).  But, then I would have to update the order property
of every other item in the list. The same goes for moving: each item and every
item in between (I can luckily skip the outer bounds) will have to be updated.
I don’t like this. There has to be a better way, I just need to figure it out.</p>

<p>Some kind of indexPath+hash? indexPath+integer?</p>

<p>Eventually I’ll reach a list size where I run into performance problems with
the brute force approach. The cop out would be to limit the size of the list.
I don’t want to do that either.  I don’t know if I’ll go to the extreme of
Brent Simmons’ data set of <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/10/05/vesper_sync_diary_2_core_data">30,000 items from Daring Fireball’s
archive</a>, but
I want to shoot for that.</p>

<p>I’ll update this post with my progress</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> 2014-05-31 01:02 PM</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1648504">This</a> is a great starting point for
dealing with reordering. I was on the right track with only dealing with the
differences between items that get moved.  Dragging an item way down on a list
may(?) not happen much, it’s annoying to do. I think I’m going with that
assumption for now.  I still don’t feel great about the number of updates for
an insert…</p>

<p>Batch fetch/update/save is my starting point</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> 2014-06-06 04:04 PM</p>

<p>It looks like iOS 8 might have better bulk update support. Downloading <a href="http://devstreaming.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/225xxgzhqylosff/225/225_hd_whats_new_in_core_data.mov?dl=1">this</a> session now</p>

            <updated>2014-03-01T20:46:39+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://www.timbroder.com/2014/03/avspeechsynthesizers-queue-doesnt-work.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sort of. It acts as a queue, but subsequent items have problems. Taken from
the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AVFoundation/Reference/AVSpeechSynthesizer_Ref/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/AVSpeechSynthesizer/speakUtterance:" title="documentation">documentation</a> of <code>- (void)speakUtterance:(AVSpeechUtterance *)_utterance_</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Calling this method adds the utterance to a <strong>queue; utterances are spoken
  in the order in which they are added to the queue</strong>. If the synthesizer is not
  currently speaking, the utterance is spoken immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true. You can queue up as many AVSpeechUtterance objects as you want,
and they will be spoken, in order.  The problem is if you try to act on the
Synthesizer after the first Utterance has been spoken. Specifically, I'm
having an issue with pausing. But, stopping has an issue as well. If I try to
pause during the first utterance using
pauseSpeakingAtBoundary:AVSpeechBoundaryImmediate, I get the expected
behavior. The speech stops and I can start it again with continueSpeaking.
(Even on the first Utterance, AVSpeechBoundaryWord, is giving me issues so I'm
putting that aside for now). However, if I try to pause on any of the
subsequent Utterances, nothing happens.  The pausedSpeaking call is ignored.
(The synthesizer isn't nil, I checked). So, why am I queuing up a lot of text?
I plan on having AVSpeechSynthesizer speak a lot of text. This text is stored
in CoreData.  Let's say my main object is called Read. Instead of storing all
of the text for that object in Read.text I've split out the text into slices,
stored in a separate Text entity. A Read object can have many of these.  This
gives me control over how much text I load into memory at once.  My original
plan was to load each slice into an Utterance.  When the speaking was done for
that Utternace, queue up the next one (it should start immediatly or close to
it). Fragments of this below:</p>

<pre><code data-language="C">    self.speechSynthesizer = [AVSpeechSynthesizer new];
    self.speechSynthesizer.delegate = self;

- (BOOL)addWordsToQueue:(NSString *)words
{
    if ( !words ) {
        return NO;
    }

    AVSpeechUtterance *utterance = [AVSpeechUtterance speechUtteranceWithString:words];
    utterance.rate = AVSpeechUtteranceMinimumSpeechRate;
    [self.speechSynthesizer speakUtterance:utterance];

    return YES;
}

//used in view
- (void)play
{
    [self.speechSynthesizer continueSpeaking];
}

- (void)pause
{
    [self.speechSynthesizer pauseSpeakingAtBoundary:AVSpeechBoundaryImmediate];
}

- (BOOL)isPaused
{
    return self.speechSynthesizer.isPaused;
}

#pragma mark - AVSpeechSynthesizerDelegate

- (void)speechSynthesizer:(AVSpeechSynthesizer *)synthesizer didFinishSpeechUtterance:(AVSpeechUtterance *)utterance
{
    NSString *words = [read getAndIncrementCurrentWordsAsString];

    if ( words != nil ) {
        [self addWordsToQueue:words];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, the first Utterance
works fine, the rest don't. I've also experimented with queueing multiple
slices at once, as well as checking if the synthesizer I get in
didFinishSpeechUtterance is the correct instance.</p>

<p>I'm
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19672814/an-issue-with-avspeechsynthesizer-any-workarounds">not</a> the first person to run into this issue.
There are also a number of
<a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/search?query=AVSpeechSynthesizer+">radars</a>. I've
added one as well.</p>

<p>There is a workaround, but it's dirty and shouldn't be
needed. In didFinishSpeechUtterance I recreate my AVSpeechSynthesizer so I'm
always dealing with the first item in the queue. I really don't like it.  This
is still broken in 7.1 beta 5. Hopefully it gets fixed. I'd like to implement
this properly.</p>

<pre><code data-language="C">- (void) resetSynth
{
    self.speechSynthesizer = [AVSpeechSynthesizer new];
    self.speechSynthesizer.delegate = self;
}

#pragma mark - AVSpeechSynthesizerDelegate

- (void)speechSynthesizer:(AVSpeechSynthesizer *)synthesizer didFinishSpeechUtterance:(AVSpeechUtterance *)utterance
{
    [self resetSynth];
    NSString *words = [read getAndIncrementCurrentWordsAsString];

    if ( words != nil ) {
        [self addWordsToQueue:words];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This unfortunately still
happens in the 7.1 beta</p>

            <updated>2013-03-23T17:38:14+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://www.timbroder.com/2013/03/automating-adding-to-trello-on-ios.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello </a>to organize my life and work. While
I kind of like it's iOS app, sometimes navigating to a board to add a card can
be a little time consuming.  I want this process to be faster. I also use
Launch Center Pro to get some quick actions that I miss from Android. Mostly
around quick communication, adding events, and now, adding to Trello.  LCP
uses x-callback-urls for inter-app communication, but Trello doesn't have any
that I could see. Inspired by Federico
<a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Viticci</a>'s article on <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/automating-ios-how-pythonista-changed-my-workflow/">automating his iOS
workflow</a>, I decided to take a crack at it using pythonista. All
code shown below can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/broderboy/PythonistaTrello">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://timbroder.com/2013/03/automating-adding-to-trello-with-launch-center-pro-and-pythonista.html/2013-02-11-14-32-57"><img src="/images/2013/02/2013-02-11-14.32.57.png" alt="2013-02-1114.32.57" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://timbroder.com/2013/03/automating-adding-to-trello-with-launch-center-pro-and-pythonista.html/2013-02-11-14-33-00"><img src="/images/2013/03/LCP.png" alt="2013-02-11
14.33.00" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a> lets you edit and run python scripts on your phone.
There are a few ways to get scripts onto your device:</p>

<ul>
<li>Edit right in the app</li>
<li>Import <a href="https://gist.github.com/omz/b0644f5ed1d94bd32805">from a gist</a></li>
<li>Use <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/">pastebot</a>. A great app that gives you multiple clipboards on your device that will also sync with your mac. This is my preferred method.</li>
</ul>

<p>The endgame of all this: I want to be able to add a card to a specific board,
with as few taps as possible. Check out this video for what we are going to
build.  Digging into the <a href="https://trello.com/docs/api/card/index.html#post-1-cards">Trello
API</a>, we can see
that to add a card, we'll need a name for the card and the ID of the list to
add it to. We also see that we'll need a token for any of the API calls. To
get all of our lists, we'll also need to know about all of our boards.  This
breaks our tasks out as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an App API Key</li>
<li>Get an API Token</li>
<li>Get a list of every board we heve</li>
<li>Get the IDs of every list on each of these boards</li>
<li>Add a new card to our list of choice</li>
</ol>

<p>To get an App API Key, you can generate one <a href="https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate" title="here">here</a>.  In theory, the one I distribute with
these scripts should be ok. Get this first script into Pythonista and run it.
It will generate a permanant API token for you that you can leave in Launch
Center Pro when running these scripts.</p>

<pre><code data-language="python">#GetTrelloToken

import webbrowser

url = 'https://trello.com/1/authorize?key=3e2cd730f3dcccbe15eaf0d39d219a37&amp;amp;name=PythonistaTrello&amp;amp;expiration=never&amp;amp;response_type=token&amp;amp;scope=read,write'

#open web browser to get a permanant Trello API Token

</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://timbroder.com/2013/03/automating-adding-to-trello-with-launch-center-pro-and-pythonista.html/2013-02-11-14-54-35"><img src="/images/2013/02/2013-02-11-14.54.35.png" alt="2013-02-11 14.54.35" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://timbroder.com/2013/03/automating-adding-to-trello-with-launch-center-pro-and-pythonista.html/2013-02-11-14-54-40"> <img src="/images/2013/02/2013-02-11-14.54.40.png" alt="2013-02-1114.54.40" /></a></p>

<p>Now that we have our key and tokens,
let's get get all of our boards and the lists on each one. Run this script and
pass in your token and your email address as arguments. (In pythonista hold
down run to get the "Run with arguments dialog"). Add your arguments separated
by spaces. For me, this could look something like: <code>"EGYlyiOdggDOaPoTUxaTQobmS6gtiX timothy.broder@gmail.com"</code></p>

<p>Finally, we'll need to take our key, the
id of the list, what we want our card to say, and hit the API with them.  I
also add in a position so the cards I add this way will appear at the top of

<p>Two things to point out inthis script:</p>

<ul>
<li>we put the name of the card at the end so we can just loop through all the remaining words and not have to worry about wrapping the name in quotes to deal with spaces.</li>

of the script, then in arguments, but everything from above except the name:
"EGYlyiOdggDOaPoTUxaTQobmS6gtiX V12t3k6RQQ2r8X top," then hit the button that
says input prompt. Now, when you run the script, Launch Center Pro will prompt
you for text, enter the name of the card and hit go.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wanted to display multiple lines of text in your Table Cell?
It's easy to do in your UITableViewController.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2012/09/2012-09-10_1921.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>First, let's define the type of font we're going to use. We'll need this in 2 places:</p>

<pre><code data-language="c">*)fontForCell { return [UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize:18.0]; } [/c] 
</code></pre>

<p>Next, calculate the height of the cell by using the height of a Label:</p>

<pre><code data-language="c">- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    NSString *cellText = /* get your text */;
    UIFont *cellFont = [self fontForCell];
    CGSize constraintSize = CGSizeMake(280.0f, MAXFLOAT);
    CGSize labelSize = [cellText sizeWithFont:cellFont constrainedToSize:constraintSize lineBreakMode:UILineBreakModeWordWrap];

    return labelSize.height + 20;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we'll set some attributes on the cell itself to change the height and
tell the text to wrap:</p>

<pre><code data-language="c">- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @&amp;quot;MyIdentifier&amp;quot;;
    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];

    if (!cell) {
        cell = [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
        cell.textLabel.lineBreakMode = UILineBreakModeWordWrap;
        cell.textLabel.numberOfLines = 0;
        cell.textLabel.font = [self fontForCell];
    }
    [cell.textLabel setText:/* get your text */;];
    cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator;
    return cell;
}
</code></pre>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are some cases when you may want to have a "Done" or "Cancel" button on
an iOs number pad when editing a text field. This doesn't come by default, but
is easy to add. See the example snippets below, or check out the code on
<a href="https://github.com/broderboy/iphone-DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar">github</a>.</p>

<p>Sample Usage:</p>

<pre><code data-language="c">//In the view controller that's going ot use the component, put this in the header after the class being extended.
&lt;DoneCancelNumberPadToolbarDelegate&gt;

// Then instantiate your toolbar component where it's needed
DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar *toolbar = [[DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar alloc] initWithTextField:textField];
toolbar.delegate = self;
textField.inputAccessoryView = toolbar;

// Finally, implement the following two delegate methods

#pragma mark - DoneCancelNumberpadToolbar delegate
-(void)doneCancelNumberPadToolbarDelegate:(DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar *)controller didClickDone:(UITextField *)textField
{
    NSLog(@&amp;quot;%@&amp;quot;, textField.text);
}

-(void)doneCancelNumberPadToolbarDelegate:(DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar *)controller didClickCancel:(UITextField *)textField
{
    NSLog(@&amp;quot;Canceled: %@&amp;quot;, [textField description]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar.h</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;

@class DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar;

@protocol DoneCancelNumberPadToolbarDelegate &lt;NSObject&gt;

-(void)doneCancelNumberPadToolbarDelegate:(DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar *)controller didClickDone:(UITextField *)textField;
-(void)doneCancelNumberPadToolbarDelegate:(DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar *)controller didClickCancel:(UITextField *)textField;

@end

@interface DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar : UIToolbar
{
    UITextField* textField;
}
</code></pre>

<p>DoneCancelNumberPadToolbar.m</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After playing Rovio's new <a href="http://teaser.amazingalex.com/">Amazing Alex</a> game
for a while, and seeing <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/07/30/amazing-alex-sales-app-store/">this article</a> on BGR this morning, it made me remember some old
success stories that I had read about, and I got to thinking about what it
would take to develop a <a href="http://sv.partypoker.com/">game</a> for iOS. More just
to see what options were out there than anything else; I know nothing about
game programming. Side note: Amazing Alex is great. If you have ever played
the incredible machine, you'll feel right at home.</p>

<p>One success story I remember is Ethan Nicholas and iShoot, which made him over $800k. Check out
how he did it, and how to get started with iOS here: <a href="http://www.lookingforiphone.com/2012/05/17/iphone-developer-in-eight-easy-steps/">iPhone developer in
eight easy steps</a>. If he can do it... why not? But, I digress.   ManiacDev
has great lists of both <a href="http://maniacdev.com/2009/08/the-open-source-iphone-game-engine-comparison/">Open Source</a> and <a href="http://maniacdev.com/2009/09/the-commercial-iphone-game-engine-comparison-3d-and-2d/">Commercial
</a>graphic engines for iOS. As far as free goes, <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">cocos2d</a> and <a href="http://gamua.com/sparrow/">sparrow</a> both jumped out
at me. Sparrow seemed like the fastest ramp-up time and after a quick look at
it's <a href="http://wiki.sparrow-framework.org/manual/display_objects">api</a>, felt
familiar. Without diving too much into the examples, it seems to follow
similar patterns to some of the python/js UI frameworks I've used.
Unfortunately, the <a href="http://forum.sparrow-framework.org/">forum</a> seems pretty
sparse. Cocos2d, while looking like a steeper learning curve, seems a little
more mature and a much more engaged community. It's forum has 85% more posts
than sparrow, which coming from a busy php/python community, I like to see. As
for commercial engines, after reading about how Infinity Blade was Epic's most
<a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/infinity-blade-is-epics-most-profitable-game-20120627/">profitable game ever</a>, and seeing that a license would only be
$99, the <a href="http://www.udk.com/">Unreal Development Kit For iOS</a> is totally the
way I would go.</p>
