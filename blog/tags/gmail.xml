            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started using Remember the Milk recently but didn't want the <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/gmail/gadget/">gmail
gadget</a> to be so far
down on the left hand side of my screen.  There is no built in way to move
gadgets to the right hand side with the exception of chat (labels used to do
this but was removed in favor of drag in drop back in late 2009).
<a href="/images/2011/04/gmail_right_widgets.png"><img src="/images/2011/04/gmail_right_widgets.png" alt="" /></a>   If you don't have anything
in the right hand column, <em>enable Right-Side Chat</em> from Gmail Labs.  We are
going to add in some custom css to gmail so install either [Stylist ](https://
chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/pabfempgigicdjjlccdgnbmeggkbjdhd)for
Chrome or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/">Stylish</a>
for Firefox. Add the following style:</p>

<pre><code>div.TZ:nth-child(8) {
position:absolute !important; 
right:0px; 
top:165px; 
width:164px; }
</code></pre>

<p>In chrome you can also restrict the domain to mail.google.com. For me, the
Remember the Milk gadget was the 8th child. Play with this until it looks
right for you. You may also have to play with the "top" element depending on
how much room your chat gadget takes up</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're playing with this at the office, pretty slick.  Seems like google just
really wants to be skype though <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JE4qNpFW6Yk/THRyAaGzsCI/AAAAAAAAAsI/Kv0RN0TmcLU/s800/screenshot2.jpeg" alt="" /> "<a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/say-hello-to-gmail-voice-and-video-chat.html">Gmail voice and video
chat</a> makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family using
your computer’s microphone and speakers. But until now, this required both
people to be at their computers, signed into Gmail at the same time. Given
that most of us don’t spend all day in front of our computers, we thought,
“wouldn’t it be nice if you could call people directly on their phones?”
Starting today, you can call any phone right from Gmail."  Full info can be
found <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/call-phones-from-gmail.html">here</a></p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the year starts to wind down, I figure I should start the year off with a
clean inbox.  I try to keep no unread messages in my inbox, instead I tag and
archive.  These past few weeks however, my inbox has gotten a little crazy.</p>

<p>I found this filter to show me all my unread mail that is still in my inbox,
hope it helps someone organize like it did me</p>

<p>is:inbox is:unread</p>

<p>Happy Holidays all</p>

<p>The <a href="http://mail.google.com/videochat?hl=en">plugin</a> isn't out for Linux so I
can't test it out just yet. Hopefully I'll be able to try it out on
<a href="http://maybe-not.net/">Laura's</a> mac later.  Until then, more info is
available <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/11/11/gmail-video-voice-chat/">here</a>.  If
you've tried it out, let me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/broderboy/">know</a>.</p>
