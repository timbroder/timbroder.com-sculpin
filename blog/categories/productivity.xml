            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airmail-2.5/id918858936?mt=12&amp;at=11laRZ&amp;ct=pro" title="Airmail2">Airmail2</a> is my desktop client of choice for Gmail. It keeps the same hotkeys as the web version of gmail and has some good integrations.</p>

<p>In outlook, I use <code>^O</code> to send an email to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id867299399?mt=12&amp;at=11laRZ&amp;ct=pro" title="Omnifocus">Omnifocus</a>. That workflow also attaches the outlook email to the task for easy reference later. I wanted something similar for gmail besides just forwarding the email to Omnifocus. With that, I still had to go find the email to actually reply to it. Omnifocus integration is the single most important reason (to me) for using Airmail. Airmail will add an in-app link back to the email in Airmail in the notes section of the task.</p>

<p>But, I don't like the default hotkey, I just want it to be <code>^O</code>. To get this to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Settings.app > Keyboard > Shortcuts</li>
<li>Add Airmail2</li>
<li>Add an action with the Menu Title of: <code>OmniFocus...</code></li>
<li>Record your keyboard shortcut to be ^O</li>
</ol>

            <id>https://www.timbroder.com/2015/10/how-to-sync-basecamp-todos-to-omnifocus-or-todoist-.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://basecamp.com/" title="Basecamp">Basecamp</a> is a large part of our process at Ai. It tracks most of our communication (a lot of this has been moving to <a href="https://slack.com/" title="Slack">Slack</a>). Basecamp serves as our system of record for signs-offs and deliverables. We also use it's "todo" function pretty heavily in the planning stages and tracking client tasks. Once we get into implementation, we transition to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" title="Jira">Jira</a>, as it's more powerful. Clients do not have access to Jira.</p>

<p>I don't have an issue tracking Basecamp tasks. It's really good at emailing you when something is due. But, as I've said before, I'd be even BETTER at it, if the tasks were <a href="http://www.timbroder.com/2015/10/using-omnifocus-as-a-honey-do-app.html" title="in my world">in my world</a>. My world is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id867299399?mt=12&amp;at=11laRZ&amp;ct=pro" title="Omnifocus">Omnifocus</a>, but there is a VERY large contingent of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-task-list/id585829637?mt=12&amp;at=11laRZ&amp;ct=pro" title="Todoist">Todoist</a> users at Ai. I am the outlier in this. In the past, my reasons for not using Todoist were I didn't want Ai tasks and personal project tasks in the same app, the hotkeys weren't up to snuff, and I didn't want to pay for premium to get notifications. I've since ignored these rules with Omnifocus; It runs everything in my life, it DOES have great hotkeys, and I dropped the $$$ for premium Omnifocus which was more expensive than Todoist premium in the long run. But, this is a topic for another post.</p>

<p>Back on track. How to get Basecamp todos into my system? Again, Zapier to the rescue. Zapier can connect to Basecamp, do some basic filtering to make sure I only get tasks that I care about, and drop them into my Omnifocus inbox. Most of the following steps hold true for both Omnifocus and Todoist</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new Zap that triggers when a new Basecamp todo is created. Have it create a new task in your system</p>

<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5713/22062008838_fe08637466_k_d.jpg" alt="" /></p></li>
<li><p>Select the appropriate Basecamp account and test it</p>

<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5776/22249798545_09e03d2937_o_d.png" alt="" /></p></li>
<li><p>Select and test your Todoist/Omnifocus account</p>

<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/737/22260363271_38415f36d9_o_d.png" alt="" /></p></li>
<li><p>Choose your Basecamp Account, Project, and Todo list. If you want to filter even more by only items assigned to you, add a custom filter. Do this by either Assignee ID or Name</p>

<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/669/22063082689_9af276bb66_o_d.png" alt="" /></p></li>
<li><p>Match up the Basecamp data to your tool of choice. First is how I send it to Omnifocus. Note, I do need to populate the due date by hand. In both options, I add the url back to the task in Basecamp so I can easy mark it off or comment in it when I'm done. Todoist lets you be a LOT more granular and handles all of the fields so you have no manual intervetntion</p>

<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/734/22062436938_6ef239ce7f_o_d.png" alt="" /></p></li>
<li><p>My tasks are now in my world. Profit.</p></li>

            <id>https://www.timbroder.com/2015/07/fussy-coffee.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the years I've <a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/06/16/the-coffee-setup-2010-i-own-a-lot-of-ways-to" title="read">read</a> or <a href="http://techdistortion.com/podcasts/pragmatic/episode-30-coffee" title="listened">listened</a> to some of the <a href="http://www.caseyliss.com/2014/7/25/neat-ice-kit" title="fussy">fussy</a> drinking <a href="https://david-smith.org/blog/2014/05/22/my-travel-coffee-kit/" title="habbits">habbits</a> of people I respect and follow.  I've been meaning to write about what I do for coffee for a while. A <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicalippke" title="coworker">coworker</a> of mine has asked and a recent post by my friend <a href="http://www.samuelstrickland.me/blog/2015/7/coffee-nerdery" title="Sam">Sam</a> kicked me to sit down and write it.</p>

<p>Sam talks about Coffee Nerdery and it made me stop and think about how much I get into it. When I was younger, "nerd" had a negative connotation. I learned to not let it bother me a long time ago. <a href="http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com/post/31143873695/now-available-for-pre-order-at-dftba-com-in" title="Nerds are passionate about many things">Nerds are passionate about many things</a>. For me it was comics, computers, books. Now, add a liiiitle bit of coffee into that.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/03/31/throwing-k-cups-in-glass-houses" title="regular coffee is just fine">regular coffee is just fine</a>. Half the time, at work, I just have a cup from the pot. (Granted, that's <a href="http://gorillacoffee.com/" title="good coffee">good coffee</a>). But, as I've written about previously, <a href="http://timbroder.com/2014/09/morning-rituals.html" title="rituals are important">rituals are important</a>. Some of what I do with coffee is for the taste. Some of it is the ritual of preparing it and the comfort that it brings. Some of it is feeling included in a club, even if that club exists only online in the form of twitter, slack, and blog posts. Because of a few of the gadgets I use, I thought I was a little nerdier. But, the gadgets is where it ends. I don't fiddle with temperature or what I use to stir. I just get good beans and prep them with what I have.</p>

<p>At the end of the day it doesn't matter. If you are passionate about something, want to throw all of your energy into it, are just curious, or just want to fiddle. Do it. If it entertains you, it scratches an itch, or you get something else out of it. Do it. Nerdism is starting to feel like a post within itself. Back to coffee.</p>

<p>Here's what I do:
I start up the kettle. When it hisses, I pour it in
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/523/19799533225_f86f5625d2_z_d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The beans I use are usually from the <a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/f4a9df89" title="Blue Bottle Coffee mail service">Blue Bottle Coffee mail service</a>. (&lt;-- referral link. help me out!) I'll do a review of the service at some point in the future. For now, check out <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/05/29/tonx-coffee" title="Marco's">Marco's</a>
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/452/19178658403_356e1f2eeb_z_d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I grind the beans by hand using a <a href="http://amzn.to/1Mefklf" title="hand">Porlex JP-30 Stainless Steel Coffee Grinder</a></p>

<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3732/19611530590_717563e7a2_z_d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/560/19773361246_66d5776853_z_d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next is brewing. I use an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HBCVX0?ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage&amp;redirect=true&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=nyen0e-20" title="AeroPress">AeroPress</a> and LOVE it.  Even if you use coffee grinds from the supermarket, the Aeropress make brewing so darned easy. Both brewing and cleaning. It makes one cup at a time. Add the coffee, the water, let it sit and then pump it out. Cleaning is just popping the "puck" of spent coffee into the garbage, rinsing everything with water, and throwing it in the drainboard. I use the "inverted method" as I find it the easiest. Check out this <a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/frequency/aeropress-video?tonx=1" title="1 min">1 min</a> Blue Bottle video that explains it. Sometimes, I also use the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aeropress-timer-for-aerobies/id602496538?mt=8&amp;at=11laRZ&amp;ct=pro" title="AeroPress Timer">AeroPress Timer</a> app on my phone that, in theory, gets a better tasting brew. I stir it with the handle of the AeroPress scoop</p>

<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/304/19611557190_c75f29d297_z_d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/259/19799586545_8fa60e61ee_z_d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most of the time, I have the coffee exactly as it comes out of the press. This is a little closer to espresso than coffee. The instructions say "add water to taste". I've been home with <a href="https://twitter.com/timothybroder/status/617041906040762368" title="Charlie">Charlie</a> the past few weeks and have been trying this. I like both, I'm not sure which method I'll end up with. Either way, I add my 2 ice cubes</p>

<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3690/19614589349_11ff2ac88c_z_d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now. Bulletproof Coffee. I've done this on and off over the past few years. Gizmodo <a href="http://gizmodo.com/bulletproof-coffee-debunking-the-hot-buttered-hype-1681321467" title="debunked">debunked</a> it earlier this year. What do I think? For the most part. It works. For the first few months, you feel like you've had rocket fuel and can do anything. Then, it tapers off. I do it a few times a year, usually close to the release of a website for a little boost. I eyeball a tablespoon or so of <a href="http://amzn.to/1Megeyb" title="Kerry Gold Butter">Kerry Gold Butter</a> and add a tablespoon of <a href="http://amzn.to/1fgmicy" title="MCT Oil">MCT Oil</a>. If you are going to try it, don't buy the bulletproof brand. It's not any better and amazon can save you money.</p>

<p>However you take your coffee; whether you are super fussy, love your starbucks, or dabble a little bit at home: <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/03/31/throwing-k-cups-in-glass-houses" title="It doesn’t matter">It doesn’t matter</a>. ENJOY your coffee</p>
