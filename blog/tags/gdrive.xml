            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you want the GDrive? I know I do. Rumors have been flying around for almost
2 years about this thing, its been the brunt of an April Fool's joke, complete
with official announcement and a Google Group (see below). Googlers use it,
and if it ever comes out, it would change the way both home and corporate
users think about file storage. Google is almost there, almost. When they
integrate Gears into Docs they'll be one step closer. They would just need a
few more features on the main Docs UI (bulk file upload, share files right
from there instead of having to publish from within the document) and allow
for any file type.</p>

<p>Quick recap of the internal GDrive / Platypus client:<br />
Backup: if your computer goes down, catches on fire, or just plain old BSOD's,
just get a new computer, install the platypus client, and your files<br />
will be on the new system before you know it You can sync across multiple
computers. Great if you have multiple buildings, cubes, or a laptop floating
around<br />
VPN-less access<br />
Disconnect Access. Google Gears anyone?<br />
Other users can just mount your shares on their filesystem<br />
FAST</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple file upload is very responsive and pretty</li>

<p>Overall I think I would have to go with Box.net. It was really smooth. Had
some good features and it was really easy to upload files. the free 5 gigs
wasn't too bad either.</p>
