            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I really have been digging the Windows 7 beta.  However, Itunes does not
sync podcasts correctly on the 64 bit version.  IF syncing works at all, it
takes a while. I had used winamp to listen to my music a while ago, but had
switched to amarok when I started single booting linux (yes, I hated Vista
that much).  Now that I'm back to using windows a bit, I wanted my podcast
experience to go flawlessly.</p>

<p>As much as I dislike iTunes, they have got podcast management down pat</p>

<ul>
<li>search for podcast</li>
<li>subscribe to podcast</li>
<li>download episodes</li>
<li>sync with ipod</li>
<li><strong>after an episode has been listened to, delete from computer hard drive</strong>
That last point is the most important part, everything else can be done
manually  </li>
</ul>

<p>All this can be done with winamp. You will need two things, winamp and the
<a href="http://mlipod.sourceforge.net/?page=downloads">ml_iPod</a> plugin.  While winamp
does come with ipod support built in, ml_iPod has many more features.  The
following steps should get you up to speed on podcasting with winamp</p>

<ul>
<li>install winamp</li>
<li>install the ml_iPod plugin (it will tell you it has to remove the built in ipod plugin, this is ok)</li>
<li>set a directory to save the episodes in  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>plug in your ipod</li>
<li>enable podcast support for the ipod</li>
<li>point it to your episode folder</li>
<li>set the query for when to delete old episodes  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Add your podcasts by searching for them in the directory, or adding them manually using their RSS feed  </li>
</ul>

<p>After this you should be good to go. podcasts!</p>
